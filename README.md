[Link to colored boxes](https://ak505188.github.io/The-Box-Challenge/)

Done in react so I could be lazy and reuse some js, deployment code, and avoid dealing
with ids in css or inline css.

Relevant files are
```
src/App.jsx
src/Box.jsx
src/App.css
```

A bit less relevant
```
public/index.html
src/index.js
```
